## Input

Input component is a component that is used to get user input in a text field.

<ComponentProps docgen={data["Input"]} />

## InputGroup

Use this wrapper whenever you need a more complex text input. For example if you need to have leading/trailing icons or addons.

<ComponentProps docgen={data["InputGroup"]} />

## InputGroup.LeadingAddon

Add any type of component that will be displayed before the input field.

This provides flexibility to include additional elements, such as buttons or dropdowns, to enhance the user interface and provide clear context or guidance to the user.

<ComponentProps docgen={data["InputGroup.LeadingAddon"]} />

## InputGroup.TrailingAddon

Add any type of component that will be displayed after the input field.

This provides flexibility to include additional elements, such as buttons or dropdowns, to enhance the user interface and provide clear context or guidance to the user.

<ComponentProps docgen={data["InputGroup.TrailingAddon"]} />

## InputGroup.LeadingIcon

Prepend a decorative icon inside the input (to the left).

<ComponentProps docgen={data["InputGroup.LeadingIcon"]} />

## InputGroup.TrailingIcon

Append a decorative icon inside the input (to the right).

This element will be replaced by a status indicator whenever the input is in error/alert/success state.

<ComponentProps docgen={data["InputGroup.TrailingIcon"]} />

## InputGroup.ClearButton

Clears the input value. Only for search inputs. This button will be shown when the user has typed something in the input.

<ComponentProps docgen={data["InputGroup.ClearButton"]} />
